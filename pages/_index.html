<h3>Open Messaging for Machine-to-Machine and Internet of Things</h3>
<div id="introText">

<br>

<p class="left">The Paho project has been created to provide scalable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging 
protocols aimed at new, exisiting, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT). 
<br>
<br>
Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost contraints of device connectivity. Its objectves include 
effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, 
designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise 
middleware and applications.  Paho is being kicked off with 
<a

</a> 
publish/subscribe client 
implementations for use on embedded platforms, along 
with corresponding server support as determined by the community.</p>

<p class="right"> This project was recently provisioned.  You can see the projects proposal 
<a href="/proposals/technology.paho">here</a>
